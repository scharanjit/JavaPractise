/*
 * 
 * A. Each String in the array lines will print, with exactly a 1-second pause between lines
	B. Each String in the array lines will print, with no pause in between because this method is
	not executed in a Thread
	C. Each String in the array lines will print, and there is no guarantee there will be a pause
	because currentThread() may not retrieve this thread
	D. This code will not compile
	E. Each String in the lines array will print, with at least a one-second pause between lines

 *D is correct. The sleep() method must be enclosed in a try/catch block, or the method
printAll() must declare it throws the InterruptedException.

E is incorrect, but it would be correct if the InterruptedException was dealt with (A is
too precise). B is incorrect (even if the InterruptedException was dealt with) because
all Java code, including the main() method, runs in threads. C is incorrect. The sleep()
method is static, it always affects the currently executing thread. (Objective 4.2)
