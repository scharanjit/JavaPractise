Given two files:
a=b.java
c_d.class
Are in the current directory, which command-line invocation(s) could complete without error?
(Choose all that apply.)
A. java -Da=b c_d
B. java -D a=b c_d
C. javac -Da=b c_d
D. javac -D a=b c_d

*Answer:
 A is correct. The -D flag is NOT a compiler flag, and the name=value pair that is
associated with the -D must follow the -D with no spaces.
